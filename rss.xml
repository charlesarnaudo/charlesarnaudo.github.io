&lt;p&gt;I use a tool called Gatsby to build this site. It’s dependices are managed through &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;, which is almost definitely the worst package manager in the world. Somehow
Gatsby itself got removed from the dependcy list so my deploys weren’t working all week. I had to dig through git commits to find it had been removed. I’ve decided to
learn more about &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; that way this doesn’t happen again. I did not anticipate having these issues with the blog but I was able to resolve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our teams were just finalized yesterday, so I’ve reached out to a few people in the group to talk about requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
