My goals for this week were to iron out the kinks in my deploy process for this blog and connect with my team to start discussion on requirements for our project.

I use a tool called Gatsby to build this site. It's dependices are managed through `npm`, which is almost definitely the worst package manager in the world. Somehow
Gatsby itself got removed from the dependcy list so my deploys weren't working all week. I had to dig through git commits to find it had been removed. I've decided to
learn more about `npm` that way this doesn't happen again. I did not anticipate having these issues with the blog but I was able to resolve them.

Our teams were just finalized yesterday, so I've reached out to a few people in the group to talk about requirements.
