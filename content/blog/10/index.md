I further modified the schema this week, removing the count table. I've reviewed backend code for phase two, as well changes to the phase one code. Later this week I'm going to help Nick work on the ui for the counting part of the app. I'd like to implement some good ways of submitting counts on both mobile and desktop. We hope to show some of our ideas thursday.
