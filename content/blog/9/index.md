I spent a lot time this week preparing for a job interview - in fact I'm writing this post from an Amtrak train right now. I made a count and user table, where a counts primary key is a `countID` and `sessionID`. This will let us keep track of which users make which counts. 

I spent some other time this week refining some timeslot and speakers ui code. The edit functionality was broken so I helped debug that.
