This past week I tried to move onto the UI team. I was expecting to help them integrate with the backend api points, as I'm familia with themr. Instead we had to choose a framework and get started on an initial UI as no code had been written. Angular was chosen, and I started the initial UI components and stubbed out the facade for the ui to use to make calls to the backend. I cut some tickets for the UI team to use for implementing the UI. It's looking like we'll need some help so I think some members of the backend team will be moving over to help out.
