Our group, team red, met yesterday ahead of our meeting in class this Thursday\nto talk more about our requirements and features. I think we have a good feel for what we want to build,\nand some of the things (features) we will need to build to do it. I think our group also has a good mix of people who are interested in doing different things - UI, backend, database, etc. We all agreed that less is more when it comes to this app, and that we should strive to make it as simple as possible. We came up with some questions to ask the client, which will help influence the features.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Third Post","date":"January 29, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/third_post/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/second_post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Second Post"}},"next":null}}
