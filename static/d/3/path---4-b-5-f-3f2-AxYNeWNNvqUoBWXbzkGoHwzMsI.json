I started working on our development environment. We are using docker\nto test the app locally. We will be running three containers - front end, backend, and db. The backend will act as an interface between the front end and db. I also started working\non a db schema based on the ERD our group created. One of the other people in our group is setting up the framework of the backend code. Our work will let the team start coding soon and\niterating on the app quickly. </p>\n<p> I’m afraid the Professor knows too much about the solution he’d like created for this problem, from a technical standpoint, which might force us into decisions we don’t want to make.\nHowever, I understand it’s tough playing both the client and tech lead. I think some freedom in decision making is needed though, without worry about what the tech lead (professor) might think. If we’re gonna make a terrible decision, yeah, please steer us away. But if it’s something mildy inconvienent or quirky, like not having a <code class=\"language-text\">timeSlot</code> table in the db, I think it’s good that you are letting us make it, even if it fails later. Part of agile is allowing us to fail fastly and iterate quickly, so we can always fix it. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fourth Post","date":"February 07, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/4/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Third Post"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fifth Post"}}}}
