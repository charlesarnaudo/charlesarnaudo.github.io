We used GitHub issues to create the tickets and Projects to track work. We have some test data in the DB now, and the backend and the db are communicating, allowing us to run tests. I picked up a ticket to write, delete and update a room. I’m running into some issues with unmarshalling the json from the request body but Andrew is going to look at it with me later this week.

We have integration tests now, api docs and logging!</p>\n<p>After this ticket I’m going to move onto the UI team for a bit to help them get started and give them some direction.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sixth Post","date":"February 20, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/6/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fifth Post"}},"next":null}}
