Javascript is the worst and I hate it. Making this websites has got me thinking more about the requirements\nfor our project, specifically the UI. I’ve also been reading a lot of <code class=\"language-text\">Why Software Sucks</code>, in which the beginning chapters are about UI. With\nthis in mind, I think the UI for our application should be served by a webpage. It should be simple, like really <strong>simple</strong>. No dumb stuff, or\nframeworks. Just some input fields and maybe display current counts. I want it to be dumb.</p>\n<p>I worry a bit about people on the team getting carried away and going to fast with the project. The longer we wait to code the better and simpler\nour app will be. IMO if this app is anything over ~1500 lines of code we messed up.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Second Post","date":"January 25, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"First Post"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Third Post"}}}}
