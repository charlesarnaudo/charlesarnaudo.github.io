Our group, team red, met yesterday ahead of our meeting in class this Thursday\nto talk more about our requirements and features.</p>\n<p>I think we have a good feel for what we want to build, and some of the things (features) we will need to build to do it. I think our group also has a good mix of people who are interested in doing different things - UI, backend, database, etc. We all agreed that less is more when it comes to this app, and that we should strive to make it as simple as possible. We came up with some questions to ask the client, which will help influence the features.</p>\n<p>Our app is shaping up to be a webapp with database. The front end might have unique features to make it easier to use from a mobile device. The database will organize the information about the sessions in a way that makes it easy for us to update and retrieve counts. There will be a layer in between the front end and back end that facilitates communication.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Third Post","date":"January 29, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/third_post/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/second_post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Second Post"}},"next":null}}
