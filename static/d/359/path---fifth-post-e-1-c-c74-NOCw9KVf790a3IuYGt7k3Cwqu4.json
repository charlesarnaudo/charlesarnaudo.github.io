It’s looking alright. <code class=\"language-text\">Go</code> makes it hard to implement some concepts of SOLID, as <code class=\"language-text\">Go</code> has it’s own opinionated way of how to write code BUT I think we did a good job of following SOLID principles. We got our db schema for phase 1 merged, and I’m working on creating some test fixtures to test our backend code on. Later this week we’ll work on getting those tests to run on pull requests, that way we know if new code passes or fails our tests. </p>\n<p>I think after I’m done with this I’ll be hopping onto the UI team to help them get rolling on their code. I don’t believe they’ve started coding or picked a framework for the UI. They’re also unfamiliar with how <code class=\"language-text\">Docker</code> works, so they’ll need help running their code locally.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fifth Post","date":"February 13, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/fifth_post/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/fourth_post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fourth Post"}},"next":null}}
